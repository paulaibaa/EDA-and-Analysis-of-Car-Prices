# EDA and Analysis of Car Prices
This project explores a dataset of cars through a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process. The analysis focuses on understanding the factors affecting car prices, including attributes such as car age, transmission type, horsepower, fuel efficiency, and brand. The project uses both univariate and multivariate techniques, including statistical summaries, visualizations, and regression models, to uncover insights about car pricing trends. Key features include:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling outliers and missing values.
- Transformation of variables (e.g., log transformation for price normalization).
- Analysis of categorical variables using one-hot encoding and visualization.
- Correlation analysis and regression modeling to quantify relationships between features and price.
- Insights presented through simple, interpretable visualizations and textual summaries.
This repository serves as a foundation for further predictive modeling or pricing strategy development.
